New Features Added:
1. Hourly Data Polling

Background Scheduler: Uses APScheduler to automatically collect metrics every hour
Automatic Collection: Starts collecting metrics 10 seconds after application startup
Persistent Storage: All metrics are saved to metrics.db instead of just logs

2. Enhanced Database Schema

metrics table: Stores detailed hourly metrics for each database node
cluster_status table: Tracks overall cluster health over time
Proper Indexing: Added indexes for better query performance


3. New API Endpoints
    /metrics/history - Historical Metrics
        # Get last 24 hours of metrics
        GET /metrics/history

        # Get last 48 hours for PostgreSQL only
        GET /metrics/history?hours=48&db_type=postgres

        # Get MySQL slave1 metrics for last 12 hours
        GET /metrics/history?hours=12&db_type=mysql&role=slave1

    /cluster/history - Cluster Status History
        # Get cluster status history for last 24 hours
        GET /cluster/history

        # Get PostgreSQL cluster history for last 7 days
        GET /cluster/history?hours=168&db_type=postgres

    /metrics/collect - Manual Collection
        # Trigger immediate metrics collection
        POST /metrics/collect

4. Data Storage Structure
    The metrics.db database contains:
    metrics table:

        Individual node metrics (connection status, version, replication lag, uptime)
        Hourly snapshots of all database nodes
        Historical performance data

    cluster_status table:

        Overall cluster health status
        Master and slave status tracking
        Cluster degradation history

5. Key Benefits

    Automatic Monitoring: No manual intervention needed
    Historical Analysis: Track trends over time
    Flexible Querying: Filter by time, database type, or node role
    Performance Insights: Identify patterns in database availability
    Alert Preparation: Historical data ready for alert threshold setting

6. Usage Examples
    Start the application and it will automatically:

    Initialize the metrics.db database
    Start collecting metrics every hour
    Provide real-time and historical data via APIs

    Monitor trends:
        # Check PostgreSQL master uptime trends over last week
        GET /metrics/history?hours=168&db_type=postgres&role=master

        # Analyze cluster degradation patterns
        GET /cluster/history?hours=720  # Last 30 days
